# pynesweeper
Slightly simplified version of minesweeper written in Python, where only one tile is shown at a time, and you enter the coordinates of tiles via your keyboard.

Setup:
After you clone this repo, run the following line in your terminal:
chmod +x pynesweeper.py
Then you can run the game by typing ./pynesweeper.py
